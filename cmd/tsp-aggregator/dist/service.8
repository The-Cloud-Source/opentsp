.SH STREAM API
To create a site feed subscriber, add a
.B Relay
the has all fields unset except
.BR Host .
.P
The feed has the following qualities:
.P
.BR Well-formed :
the data is guaranteed to be valid according to the opentsdb.net specification.
.P
.BR Uncompressed :
the data appears in plain text without drops due to deduplication.
.P
.BR "Canonical format" :
no whitespace beyond spaces (no tabs). All spaces squeezed (no repeats).
.P
.BR "Delivery guarantee" :
at-most-once.
.P
.BR "Delivery delay" :
the only deliberate algorithmic (by design) delay is that due to Nagle's
algorithm.
.P
.BR "Order guarantee" :
order preserving; data points in each time series arrive in strictly monotonic
time order (no duplicates).
.P
.BR "Reconnect strategy" :
on connection error, first reconnect is immediate. Subsequent reconnects are
separated by pauses that increase exponentially starting at 1s, up to a limit of
600s.
